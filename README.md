## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Shivum and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

## Interests
I have keen interest in security, more specifically cybersecurity and security engineering. I am in the process of learning full-stack development and hoping to apply my knowledge through a security application project.
